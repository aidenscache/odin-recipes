        <h2> Description </h2>      
        <p> 
            This crowd-pleasing flank steak marinade consists of the following ingredients: 
            vegetable oil, soy sauce, red wine vinegar, lemon juice, Worcestershire sauce, 
            Dijon mustard, garlic, and ground black pepper.
        </p>
        <p>
            As long as you marinate the flank steak in the fridge for two to six hours, 
            you'll have great results. However, for the absolute best results, marinate overnight or up to 12 hours.
